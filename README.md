## 4 Â· Methodology
1. **Data ingestion**â€ƒLoad the CSV, verify schema, coerce types.  
2. **KPIs**â€ƒCompute enrollment counts, completion & dropout percentages by department and duration.  
3. **Visual analytics**â€ƒGenerate:
   - Bar chart: completion % by department  
   - Scatter + trend: mentor interactions vs. completion outcome  
   - Heat-map: completion % across duration Ã— department  
4. **Deployment**â€ƒServe with Streamlit Cloud (free tier), automatically rebuilding on each Git push.

## 5 Â· Key Insights
- Engineering hosts the largest cohort (~42 %) and still maintains a respectable 69 % completion rate.  
- Design lags at 66 % despite shorter internshipsâ€”suggests a mentoring gap.  
- Each additional weekly mentor touch-point lifts completion probability by **â‰ˆ 5 percentage points**.  
- 12â€“16 week programs balance completion and resource cost most effectively.
